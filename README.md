# OnlineClothingStore

OnlineClothingStore is a full-stack web application for an online clothing store. It uses Next.js and Tailwind CSS for the frontend, Express.js (Node.js) for the backend, and MongoDB (with Mongoose) as the database. The application follows the MVC (Model-View-Controller) pattern and uses RESTful API principles.
